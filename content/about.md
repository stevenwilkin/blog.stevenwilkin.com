My name's Steve, I'm 31 years old and I live in [Belfast](http://www.gotobelfast.com/). Some people may know me as "Biscuit" which my friend [Keith](http://skryshof.com/) christened me some years ago: his reasoning for this was good at the time but unfortunately no one can remember the details now ;)

I'm currently working as a technical consultant with a range of small and multinational organisations.

I'm obsessed with computing and enjoy movies, music and books; my literary taste extends to biographies of my favourite musicians, hard science fiction and the works of Robert Anton Wilson. I balance these geeky activities out with a keen interest in health, fitness and strength training, which over the past few years has become a driving force in my life.
