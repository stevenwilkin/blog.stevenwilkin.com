I'm now at [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBelfast), hyped up on free coffee and looking forward to the upcoming geekiness.

It's been years since I set foot in a lecture theatre at [Queen's](http://www.qub.ac.uk/) and in fact, I think I used to attend Computer Architecture lectures in the very room I'm in now.

The line-up for today includes both technical and non-technical topics. and unsurprisingly, it's the techy stuff that's appealing to me more, in particular the planned talks on [Zope](http://www.zope.org/) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

Geek on!
