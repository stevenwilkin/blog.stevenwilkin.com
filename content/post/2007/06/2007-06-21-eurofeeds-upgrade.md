Not 2 days after mentioning [my initial impressions of EuroFeeds](/2007/06/19/change-in-usenet-provider/) usenet service I get an email notifying me that they have upgraded retention on binary newsgroups to 60 days, with a planned upgrade to 85 days over the summer, as well as doubling the number of simultaneous connections on unlimited accounts from 4 to 8. Nice.

I'm looking forward to testing this out :)
