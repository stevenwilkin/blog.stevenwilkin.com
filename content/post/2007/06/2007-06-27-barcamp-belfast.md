It looks like I'll be attending [BarCamp](http://www.barcamp.org/BarCampBelfast) this Saturday. I had initially ruled it out, what with my hectic schedule, but [my employer](http://mac-sys.co.uk/) is sponsoring the event and as such I'll be able to get Monday off work in exchange for representing the company. Happy Days.
