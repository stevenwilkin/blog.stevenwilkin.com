For nearly a week now I have been exclusively using an [Eee PC](/2007/12/22/asus-eee-pc/). I promised an action shot and here it is:

Using this device I have went about all my regular activities, even a bit of web development.

The biggest hindrance I've found has been using a screen resolution lower than what I'm accustomed to and I'm not too keen on the button strip below the trackpad but I **have** gotten used to the keyboard to an extent though would certainly benefit from smaller hands ;)

Enough negativity, buy one today!
