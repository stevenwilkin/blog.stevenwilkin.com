I picked up a new bicycle earlier today after probably a decade of not as much as even getting on one. I'm suprised how quickly it all came back to me, almost instantaneously in fact.

It only took me 10 minutes to get home from Sainsbury's with a pannier bag stuffed full with groceries. My life has taken on new meaning!
