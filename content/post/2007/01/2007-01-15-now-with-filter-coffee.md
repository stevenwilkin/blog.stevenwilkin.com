Coffee time came around this morning at 11am just like it always does, but when I got to the kitchen there was no sign of the usual paraphernalia. I was placed in a moral dilemma: do I selfishly get busy with the 1 mug french press or dive into the catering-sized drum of Nescafe Original Blend? Thankfully, before I had to make my mind up, the green light was given for the purchase of some new equipment, so [Phil](http://philipadamson.blogspot.com/) and myself picked up some funds from petty cash and hit the [Argos](http://www.argos.co.uk/) around the corner.

We had money to burn and the need for something shiny. The laminated book of dreams was consulted and we decided on a [Morphy Richards "Cafe Matlino"](http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/4225276.htm) filter machine; the product number was written down and handed to the girl behind the counter, money changed hands and we awaited our new piece of kit. Within a few brief minutes the prize was ours and we headed back to the office, unpacked the machine and set it up for a water-only brew to cleanse the system. Here's an action shot from the first pot of coffee produced:

The machine has an array of esoteric buttons, lights and displays which the documentation insists are used to have the brewing process instigated at a predestined time. Personally I prefer the technique prescribed by [Terry Tate, Office Linebacker](http://youtube.com/watch?v=aS3cjuU5tTA): "_yo' kill the joe yo' make some mo'!_" Namely, having a pot of black gold available at _all_ times during the day. Already my mind is filled with ideas along the lines of the infamous [Trojan Room coffee machine](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/coffee.html), the granddaddy of all web-cams.

As an interesting end note, when I was checking out the Argos site I discovered a potential for Cross Site Scripting, look at the breadcrumb trail on [this page](http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/4225276/Trail/C%24cip%3D42001.Steve+is+teh+roxx0r!!1!.htm)!
