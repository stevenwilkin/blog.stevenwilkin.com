It's now a week into the new year and to heighten my perception of the passage of time my birthday fell on the 3rd, making me a ripe 27. I've been thinking long and hard about what I want to achieve this year and the essence of my ruminations was progression: my goal is to make progress in all my hobbies and interests and, of course, life in general. Some prominent points which came to mind are to:

- continue bodybuilding
- write more code
- blog more
- increase Linux skills
- get a "real" job

Those activities pretty much sum up what I do in my life on a day-to-day basis and the only serious challenge will be finding gainfully employment as voluntary work just doesn't pay the bills. The idea of it still sends chills up my spine but paid work would make other pursuits financially viable as well as advance my career and technological skill-set. Well, that's what I'm telling myself anyway!

This might also be the year in which I make my return to academia: the job paper on Friday had an ad for postgraduate study at QUB, as well as one for the job I applied for last month and got knocked back for... I've regretted at times changing my undergraduate degree pathway from MEng to BSc and absolutely regret opting out of the year of industrial placement when I _was_ studying towards an MEng, so postgrad work has been on my mind for a while and every year I consider applying but don't. Maybe this time around...

That's my piece said but don't assume that I'll actually hold myself to any of it, goodnight!
