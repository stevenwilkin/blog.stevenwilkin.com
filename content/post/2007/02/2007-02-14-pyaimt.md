Last week I found myself with the need to communicate with some people via AIM. I'd never bothered with that particular protocol before but being a Linux enthusiast I detected the opportunity for a bit of geekery...

All my IM needs are taken care of by [jabberd](http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/2/) running on `substance`. I can communicate directly with the people I know who use [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/) and I've the [MSN transport](http://delx.cjb.net/pymsnt/) running to keep in touch with a few folks using that network, so, instead of taking the easy route and switching to a multi-protocol client, I opted to install the [AIM transport](http://pyaim-t.blathersource.org/).

I downloaded the latest release, extracted it to `/usr/local/pyaim-t` and proceeded to simply, almost blindly, follow the given instructions.

I assigned a JID to the transport, `aim.nulltheory.com`, added the info into `/usr/local/pyaim-t/config.xml` and created a corresponding subdomain in my [dynamic DNS](http://zoneedit.com/) settings.

I added the transport details into `/usr/local/etc/jabberd/router-users.xml` and added an alias for `chatroom.aim.nulltheory` into `/usr/local/etc/jabberd/router.xml`. No heavy lifting so far...

I restarted `jabberd` and, fingers crossed, launched the transport with `python /usr/local/pyaim-t/PyAIMt.py &`, used my [Jabber client](http://gajim.org/) to discover the available services and there it was, w00t!

The whole process took the minimum of effort and the lengthiest part was signing up for an AIM account: once I had that it was plain sailing to register with the transport and add the contacts to my roster. Open-source to the rescue once again :)
