I'd finished reading the last interesting book in my stack on Saturday morning so I wandered down to Waterstone's to pick up something to tide me over until I got my act together and ordered some of the items on my Amazon wish list.Â  On Tuesday afternoon I waved bye-bye to a few shekels and seeing as I'd still a good bit to go on the book I bought at the weekend I opted for the free delivery. The order was confirmed at 2:36pm. The delivery man was at my door 25 minutes ago.

Free delivery and within 48 hours, I'm impressed! Hard sci-fi cyber-punk shenanigans aplenty!
