A [trailer clip](http://yearzero.nin.com/) for [Nine Inch Nails](http://www.nin.com/) upcoming album [Year Zero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails#Year_Zero) was released today and I'm sitting here, taking some time out from coding, listening to the tracks from it which were recently "leaked".

The tracks are: ["Survivalism"](http://www.ninwiki.com/Survivalism_%28song%29)(the forthcoming single,) ["My Violent Heart"](http://www.ninwiki.com/My_Violent_Heart) and ["Me, I'm Not"](http://www.ninwiki.com/Me%2C_I%27m_Not). It's these last 2 which were discovered on USB drives in toilet cubicles at a couple of recent gigs. The files are all 320 kbit/s CBR MP3s and I've had the 3 of them on repeat. I can't wait until the final album is released!
