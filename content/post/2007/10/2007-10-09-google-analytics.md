I got speaking to [Matt](http://blog.infurious.com/) this morning when I arrived in the office and he demonstrated to me the wealth of information provided by [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/). It was really interesting stuff and I could see why he was so excited about it.

I recently upgraded to Apache 2.2 on my development machine, `substance`, to "easily"¬ù get TLS working so I could use [AjaxTerm](/2007/10/02/ajaxterm/) and I haven't had the time yet to play about getting [awstats](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/) up and running again.

I wouldn't call myself a blogger and my site doesn't draw huge traffic but it's still nice to look at the statistics every once in a while so I decided to give it a go.

Signing up was effortless as with all things Google and the only modification required at my end was to add a reference to the urchin Javascript in my site footer.

All I have to do now is to let the numbers crunch :)
