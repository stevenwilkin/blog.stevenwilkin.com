It's been a busy week. [The lads](http://infurious.com/) and myself have been quite industrious, making plans and Getting Things Done.

I've taken on responsibility of taking care of the Linux side of things and last night finished setting up an SSL enhanced, WebDAV accessible [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) repository, for which Aidan has written an [introductory guide](http://godswearhats.com/2007/10/18/how-to-use-subversion-an-absolute-beginners-guide/).

My current task is getting [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) installed and I'm quite enjoying being up to my elbows in command line goodness. It must be the Linux hippy in me ;)

There's definitely an atmosphere of excitement about the endeavour and it makes the day job seem more tolerable knowing there could be more interesting things on the horizon. Geek on!
