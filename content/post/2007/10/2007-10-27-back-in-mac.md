I'm writing this on the shiny iMac [Matt](http://cimota.com/blog/) dropped off the other night. As it stood, I was the only guy in [Infurious](http://infurious.com/) not on the Mac platform, which is a pretty fundamental prerequisite for working in a Mac shop, don't you think?

I'm having to get re-used to the keyboard again and the mouse is giving me some difficulty which might just be due to the mouse itself, but all-in-all it's been a not-unpleasant experience so far!

I'd forgotten how _elegant_ the whole Mac lifestyle is. I'm used to Linux on my desktop and so I'm accustomed to a certain degree of clunkiness and things not always working the way I'd like. Not to mention that I have to use Windows 2000 during the 9 to 5, so it's been like a breath of fresh air, which makes the contrast even greater.

I do most of my work on Linux boxen via the command line, along with a web browser and a mail client, so at the end of the day I have a similar experience no matter which platform I'm on and through the magic of free software I can use pretty much the same applications which makes things even easier.

Now that I have the hardware, you never know, I might actually become a "Mac Guy"¬ù yet!
