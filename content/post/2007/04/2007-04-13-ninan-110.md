The latest stable of Ninan was [released a few days ago](http://www.ninan.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=24) and I've just gotten around to upgrading [my installation of it](/2007/01/18/ninan-105-on-slackware-110/).

There wasn't much to the upgrade process: I downloaded and untared the archive and I thought I'd play it smart and copy over my old `ninanconfig.xml` and it appeared to work, but gave up the ghost when it came to actually downloading something. I renamed the file, restarted Ninan, reentered all my details and preferences and I'm now happily downloading at 1.2 MB/s :)

I love this program although I still haven't put the effort into getting the restart feature to work and I'm not too keen on having to use the memory-hog that is Java to run it, but Ninan does the job at hand and does it well.

May the leeching resume!
