It was Sunday morning and I went through my usual routine: I got up, flicked on the coffee machine which I had filled with water and ground coffee the night before and went to the bathroom. I decided to get back into my bed for a bit and whilst I was lying there I heard a cracking sound. I feared the worst, thinking: "please not my precious caffeine preparation paraphernalia" and sure enough the black goodness was weeping from the pot and sizzling on the hotplate. Poor photography aside, here's the fallen soldier:

My brother and his fiancee presented me with [the machine](http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/4227755.htm) Christmas before last, my love of the stuff being what it is, so it had seen well over a year of practically daily use. Not wanting to disrupt my morning routine for the next day I decided to head down to Argos after a swim to pick up a [replacement](http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/4226464.htm). Here's the new machine on its maiden run:

For a good while I've been thinking about getting a more ["professional" filter machine](http://www.bravilor.com/bravilor?nav=fnroHsHzGaKtKgDnCLJE) so I decided not to spend big and the model I choose was inexpensive yet fits my needs precisely, fitting in well with the [remainder of my coffee equipment](/category/coffee/). It truly is an obsession :)
