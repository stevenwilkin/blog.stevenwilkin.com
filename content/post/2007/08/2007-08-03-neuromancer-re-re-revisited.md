![Neuromancer](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/neuromancer.jpg)I was having a quick look through some second-hand books last weekend and happened across a copy of [Neuromancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) by [William Gibson](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/), the "father of cyber-punk"¬ù. I had to have it and this marked the third time I've purchased a copy of this seminal work.

I started into it on the bus home yesterday and it still seems fresh. Neuromancer is one of the very few books I've read more than once and I've enjoyed it every time, so much so I've lost track of the exact number of times I've read it.

I'm a huge Gibson fan and can't wait to get a copy of his latest book, [Spook Country](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0670914940?tag=sickbiscuitco-21) :)
