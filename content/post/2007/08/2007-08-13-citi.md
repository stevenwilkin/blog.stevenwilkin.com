I started [my new job](/2007/07/30/new-adventures-in-clerical-progression/) as an Analyst Programmer with [Citi](http://www.citi.com/domain/index.htm) today and so far I don't have a login, my own machine or a permanent pass card and I'm not completely sure what exactly it is I'll actually be doing but I _have_ mastered the use of the coffee machine. It's all good :)
