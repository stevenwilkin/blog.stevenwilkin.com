Since my last update strength training I've progressed from 3 sets of 5 reps to 5 sets of 5 reps: the infamous 5x5.

I'm still training 3 days a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday before work, still not doing any cardio and the [Osgood Schlatters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgood-Schlatter_disease) is still giving me gip.

Here's what my routine has been like lately:

- Monday
    - Front Squat
    - Overhead Press or Dumbbell Bench Press
    - Clean
- Wednesday
    - Front Squat
    - Overhead Press or Dumbbell Bench Press
    - Barbell Row
- Friday
    - Front Squat
    - Overhead Press or Dumbbell Bench Press
    - Deadlift

I'm training the front squat every session and alternating the overhead press and the dumbbell bench press between sessions. Taking into mind my knee difficulties I'm training the squat with relatively low intensity and wearing a knee sleeve which is giving me a much needed opportunity to work on my form and control.

As an aside, I've been working towards another goal: making it into the light-heavyweight division. It's been tough going, I'm sick of the sight of food a lot of the time and have even been supplementing with vitamin B12 to see if I can boost my appetite sufficiently. I'll be sure to let you know if I hit this milestone :D
