Well, it only took me [2 and a half years](/2006/10/18/ruby-on-rails/) but I finally used Rails to develop a catalogue for my DVD collection.

The catalogue loosely fits in with my series of [nano-apps](/2009/01/26/nano-apps/) and is hosted on [movies.stevenwilkin.com](http://movies.stevenwilkin.com/). The code is publicly available on [GitHub](http://github.com/stevenwilkin/movies.stevenwilkin.com) for anyone who's interested.

All's left now is to actually _use_ the system and fill in the details of my collection!
