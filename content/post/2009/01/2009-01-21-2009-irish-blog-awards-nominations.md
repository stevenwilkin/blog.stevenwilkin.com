![Irish Blog Awards 2009 - Nominated](/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/nominated.png "Irish Blog Awards 2009 - Nominated")

I've been quiet lax on the blog front for a while now, both in terms of producing and consuming blog content. Curse you [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stevebiscuit)!

So it came as quiet a surprise while reading one of [Matt's blog posts](http://cimota.com/blog/2009/01/20/irish-blog-award-nominations-2009/) to discover my humble blog had been nominated in the Best Personal Blog category of the [2009 Irish Blog Awards](http://awards.ie/blogawards/2009/01/20/2009-irish-blog-awards-nominations/).

Must. Blog. More.

**Update:** Thanks to [DavyMac](http://www.davymac.com/wordpress/) for the great logo!
