I can be an awfully indecisive person at times. Often I've been in the grips of [analysis paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) unable to pick a course of action to take, crippled with choice.

When I was a student I read [The Dice Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dice_Man) and was sorely tempted to make all my decisions by rolling a die or tossing a coin. Needless to say this is maybe not the best way for a person to navigate through life.

Recently I had to contemplate a specific yes/no situation and joked with the idea of tossing a coin to decide. It then occured to me that I could go one better and after a little bit of tinkering wth Objective-C this is what I made:

[![Decisions App - Yes](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/decisions_app_yes.gif "Decisions App - Yes")](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/decisions_app_yes.gif)

Upon touching the screen the text alternates between "Yes" and "No" and after a random period of time between 1 and 3 seconds it stops. Simple.

This app scratches an itch and it'll likely never see any additional work though a possible future addition would be to allow a user defined number of free-text choices, maybe even with weighting towards one choice or another.

The source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevenwilkin/decisions) if you think it could be useful for anything.
