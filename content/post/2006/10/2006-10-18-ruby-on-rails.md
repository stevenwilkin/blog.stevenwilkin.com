I decided last week to see what all the hype was about and have a look at [Ruby On Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). I've been meaning to catalogue my DVD collection on my site for a good while now but nothing ever materialised, so I've got something to work towards and if RoR delivers what it promises I should get something up and running quite quickly.

The first thing to do was to track down some kind of reference material to learn from and [this book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/097669400X?tag=sickbiscuitco-21) seemed like the right place to start. I had a lot of fun printing a [warez'd](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=warez) PDF of it out on the office's malfunctioning [lazer printer](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/uk/en/sm/WF06b/5043-5047-5051-5051-326389-326399-761853.html) and then binding it, but the end product will more than fill my needs.

Getting all the software goodness installed was thankfully a lot less painful than I expected. [Slackware Packages](http://packages.slackware.it/) provided me with the current version of [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and once that was installed downloading and setting up [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/) was effortless. The only problem I had was using RubyGems to install the [Rails framework](http://www.rubyonrails.org/), but after scratching my head and googling like a fiend I found out that [RubyForge](http://rubyforge.org/) was offline and when I came back from my lunch break it was up and running again and I could finish setting up my Ruby On Rails installation.

So far I have read through the introductory material and the Ruby language summary and have started working on my movie project while following the shopping cart case study. The best term I can think of to describe my first impressions of this system is _weird_. The language seems so foreign compared to what I am used to but I do like the idea of having a [MVC architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) built in from the start of a project. I don't know a huge amount about design patterns so I'm hoping to learn a bit here and hopefully apply the principles to future endeavours.

Most of what I have achieved so far has been through blindly following the text and without a huge amount of understanding and I don't yet know if I even like this stuff but I do intend to stick it out for this project and share the results here. Web 2.0 here I come!
