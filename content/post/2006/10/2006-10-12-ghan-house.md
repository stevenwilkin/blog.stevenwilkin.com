Early yesterday morning we were all bundled onto a bus and were delivered to [Ghan House](http://www.ghanhouse.com/), down in [Carlingford](http://www.carlingford.ie/) for a spot of staff team building. Turning up on time meant me getting out of bed earlier than usual, so from the get go I was less than enthusiastic about the whole affair, but I weighed in and did my bit regardless.

We were split into 2 teams, with the objective being for each team to cook 3 courses of culinary delight. Our team's task was to cook an Italian themed meal while the others whipped up a range of Irish dishes. It was interesting to see the end results of our labours: we did our thing which didn't look particularly haute cuisine and the establishment staff took this away and presented it to us professionally. It was hard to believe it was the same food we had prepared earlier.

The latter part of the day was spent doing an assortment of exercises which I'm assuming were meant to help us feel closer as a team. One activity which stood out involved each person in turn saying what they enjoyed most about the day, followed up with a compliment of the person seated to their immediate left. The [brown-nosing](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=brown+nose) that came into play here was nauseating to say the least and when it came to my turn I was well and truly stumped, I just couldn't think of anything that I had enjoyed about the day!

Over the past couple of years, as I've gotten more and more obsessed with training and nutrition, food as become more or less functional and the taste and enjoyment of it has been relegated to secondary importantance. There was a lot of butter, double cream and so on involved in the preparation of the food and I wasn't looking forward to having to eat it, knowing that my nutritional requirements weren't going to be met, but I must admit it was tasty and skipping dessert helped me not feel quite _so_ unhealthy.

Yep, obsession in all areas, I wouldn't have it any other way.
