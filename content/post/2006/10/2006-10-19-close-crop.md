Once again I got sick of the length of my hair: it had been a while since I had done anything to it and I felt it was looking untidy and I hated having no option but to style it in the mornings and after the gym, so last night I charged up the trusty clippers and [set to work](http://www.headshaver.org/).

I set the clippers to the longest setting and started off with a random swipe of my hair, thinking "this is it, no turning back." I looked in the mirror and was a bit shocked: I didn't expect the result to be quite _as_ short as it was. Ah well, on with the show! Here's me at the moment of completion:

Things have certainly been different since I got rid of my ponytail last summer: I haven't been completely satisfied with any haircut I've had and I'm not exactly over the moon with having cropped hair. Saying that though, it _is_ convenient and costs nothing after the initial purchase of the clippers.

If only I didn't look like a convict.
