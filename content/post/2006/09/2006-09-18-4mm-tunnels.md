I had been thinking about it for some time and finally decided to just go for it. So, a couple of hours ago I was signing the waiver and getting ready to get my [ear lobes stretched](http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Earlobe_Stretching) for the first time.

I can remember not liking the whole flesh tunnel thing, but over time, what put me off them was what happens when you remove the jewelery: the "cat's arse" look. Today I just gave in though and here are my ears less then 15 minutes after I left [the piercing shop](http://www.niptap.com/OTHERSIDE.html):

[![Left Ear](/gallery/d/66-2/left_ear.jpg "Left Ear")](/gallery/curiosities/left_ear.jpg.html) [![Right Ear](http://sickbiscuit.com/gallery/d/69-2/right_ear.jpg "Right Ear")](/gallery/curiosities/right_ear.jpg.html) 

It wasn't exactly a pleasant experience, having a [taper](http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Taper) forced into an existing piercing but I'm told that the first stretch is the worst and that it should be easier as the [gauge](http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Gauge) increases. I can only describe it as a burning, tearing sensation and it has been so long since I was last pierced that I couldn't say if was any better or worse than my previous experiences.

I was initially unsure about the look of the [CBRs](http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Cbr) sitting behind each tunnel, but after looking at the photos (taken with my [now silent](http://www.scott.frih.net/articles/index.html) camera phone) I don't think they look _too_ bizarre. Time will tell what I do about them though: when I was younger I thought more was better but I've come to believe that quality is better than quantity, so I might take them out or possibly change the jewelry.

Now all I need is another tattoo and my life will be complete (well, for half an hour anyway!)
