[![Squat!](/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/bbsquat.gif "Squat!")](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BBSquat.html)

Over the past couple of months I've been working at removing machine weights from my training regime but up until last week I was using machines exclusively to train my legs.

My mate Tony had shown me how to [squat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_%28exercise%29) a good few months ago but not only was I afraid of injuring my back with improper form I was downright intimidated by this, the daddy of all exercises.

I spent a good chunk of time reading about the [technique](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/9963616097/?tag=sickbiscuitco-21) involved and last Thursday I stepped into the power cage to give it a go. I started practicing with just the bar and proceeded to add a couple of 10 Kg plates, being very conscience of my form and trying to get a full range of movement. I had difficulty getting my [quads](http://exrx.net/Muscles/Quadriceps.html) parallel to the floor and some guy started giving me his "advice." He told me about stretching my achilles tendons (thank you) but then went on to suggest I put a plate under each heel... I tried this approach without any weight and found I could get down deep enough but I had read discouraging things about this technique, so I thanked the guy and went back to what I was doing before, safe in the knowledge that if I put the practice in I'll get there eventually.

I upped the weight a bit more and did a set of 10 reps. A modest beginning but when I stepped out of the power cage my heart was beating fast and I was covered in sweat, a sure sign that I had done something right.

Last night I was back. I found supporting the weight across my [traps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezius) a bit easier (with less pain in that area today than last Friday) and gradually increased the weight through successive sets and finished on a set of 10 reps with 40 kilos of plates on the bar. This is a fraction of the weight I was doing with a leg-press machine but I've found it to be a completely different experience. About half-way into the set I had one of those "uh-oh" moments; I was trying to squat as deep as I could and had paused slightly before my ascent. I think my right knee or my torso moved slightly and I thought "I'm not going to make it back up," but the moment passed and I finished my reps, breathing heavy with my heart pounding.

It's going to be some time before I start doing work sets, but the love/hate relationship with this exercise has begun!
