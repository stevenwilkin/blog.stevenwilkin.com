I was reading a discussion on Lifehacker this morning about [listening to music while studying](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/ask-the-readers/ask-the-readers--best-music-for-studying-198284.php), whcih mentioned an earlier post about [pink noise](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/top/download-of-the-day--noise-157126.php). Between the guy on the radio and one of my coworkers I knew I **had** to take action or suffer [the consequences](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=your+stress+is+my+stress). I felt a [MacGyver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver) moment coming on.

One of the comments on the pink noise post led me to download [a little app](http://www.moshier.net/pink.html) which generates a wave file containing 12 seconds [of the stuff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise). A hop, skip and a jump over to SourceForce enriched me with a copy of [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) which enabled me to copy-and-paste to my wee hearts delight and voila, 50 minutes of pink noise in an mp3 sandwich which I swiftly [transfered to my iPod](http://www.ephpod.com/). Powerful.

I'm listening to it now while I'm writing this post. It reminds me of Lou Reed's [Metal Machine Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Machine_Music) and like MMM, I don't know if I like it and I may well either be sick or go mad.

Now if I only had some [duct tape](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088559/quotes)...
