Richard just drew my attention to [this news item](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5344676.stm) describing [Banksy's](http://www.banksy.co.uk/) latest escapade, [an exhibition](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/5344770.stm) which includes a _"37-year old Indian elephant \[...\] painted, from head to tail, in a floral pattern reminiscent of an old fashioned living room or a British pub_," genius!

I hadn't heard of [Banksy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy) before until I read about him [replacing 500 copies of Paris Hilton's album](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5310416.stm) in record shops with CDs containing music by Danger Mouse and featuring [doctored artwork](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sharl/sets/72157594266743665/). I immediately thought "I like the way this guy thinks!"

Looks like I've just got myself a new IM avatar!
