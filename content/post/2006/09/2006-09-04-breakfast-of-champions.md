I had a bit of a lie-in on Saturday and I was hitting the gym at 10am so I was only going to get the opportunity for one meal before my workout. I knew I would have to have a slightly larger breakfast than normal. When the food was on the plate my first thought was "I have to eat all of that?" followed by the need to photograph it:

I wish I had put something in the photo to reference the size of the plate against! Needless to say, it was both tasty and nutritious with the combination of porridge and scambled eggs providing approximately 60g carbs, 30g protein and a whopping 14g fat (I had 3 yolks instead of my usual 2.)

Supplement-wise, I had a multi-vitamin, a fish-oil capsule and a couple of grams of [creatine](http://www.absolute-creatine.com/) (I've been giving this a go for a few weeks now and it seems to have had a positive effect on my training.)

Training is one of the most consistently difficult things I've ever done and some times I just hate doing it but the pay-off is so great in terms of stress relief, increased confidence and maybe some day I'll actually have a decent physique!
