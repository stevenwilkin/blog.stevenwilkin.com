Yesterday the mood took me and I went hunting for some new coffee making appartatus. I didn't get a replacement glass for my french press which was my original intention, but I did pick up a [stove-top espresso maker](http://www.bialetti.it/uk/catalogue/scheda.asp?id_cat=24&pag=1) and have spotted where to get the necessary component for [my fallen Bodum](http://sickbiscuit.com/blog/2006/09/19/bye-bye-bodum/), which shall be acquired at some point in the near future.

It was a bit of a mission tracking this piece of equipment down, but just when I had given up I bumped into a work colleague who pointed me in the direction of [Habitat](http://www.habitat.co.uk/) who could thankfully satisfy my needs. I walked home via the supermarket and picked up some fine-ground [italian coffee](http://www.lavazza.com/) to go with my new toy:

![Moka And Espresso Grounds](http://sickbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/moka_and_grounds.jpg)

I eagerly read the included instructions, washed and filled the moka and went ahead with making my first, sacrificial, batch of [espresso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso). The smell of the fresh coffee was fantastic and I was a bit disheartened with having to pour it down the sink, but I wasted no time getting setup for another run and wasn't disappointed with the results.

The process gave me a mug(!) of rich, black, steaming espresso which I drank as fast as I could. I could feel the muscles in my jaws tighten, my stomach got a bit queasy and all I could think was "this is great, I _need_ more!" I resisted the desire for another spin on the roundabout and needless to say, I didn't feel entirely sleepy when it was time for me to get into bed.

Today I have went through the ritual no less than 4 times and counting my saturday afternoon routine of a quadruple shot americano at Starbucks with the troops, my espresso shot count is easily in the high twenties. And all I can think of is having more.
