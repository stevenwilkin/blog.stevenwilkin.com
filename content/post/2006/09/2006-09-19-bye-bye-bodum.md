I was doing a bit of washing up last night before I went to bed and as [Fortuna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna_%28mythology%29) would it, the glass component of my cafetière fell over in my dish rack and promptly broke. It was made of [Pyrex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrex) / [borosilicate glass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borosilicate_glass) and the fall seemed so _mild_ for want of a better term so I felt both shocked and confused that such a thing could happen. Here's a snap of the fallen soldier:

I would have had that particular piece of paraphernalia for 2 years next month, though I haven't used it much since christmas when my brother and his missus donated a filter coffee maker to the cause, which has seen daily use. I guess it was just it's Time. Ahh, the fond memories of sitting in front of my monitor at 4 in the morning with a steaming mug of java at hand. It will be missed.

I see that Amazon sell [replacement parts](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bodum-Spare-Glass-Coffee-Makers/dp/B0000CF2WM/) so I'll scope out the prices in town in my lunch break, compare and contrast and decide on my next action.

Less mourning and more coding...
