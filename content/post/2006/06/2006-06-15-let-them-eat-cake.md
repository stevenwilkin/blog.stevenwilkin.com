I was chatting to [Phil](http://philipadamson.blogspot.com/) yesterday and we got to talking about the antics in the staff room at break time:

I put off posting about it but the [Imp of the Perverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imp_of_the_Perverse) was busy whispering into my ear and I finally [gave in](http://www.craigslist.org/cgi-bin/search?areaID=1&subAreaID=0&query=submissive&catAbbreviation=cas&minAsk=min&maxAsk=max). What is it with [middle-aged women](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=milf) and [confectionary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_fetishism)?
