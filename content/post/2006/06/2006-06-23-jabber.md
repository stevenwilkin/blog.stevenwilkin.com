![Jabber Powered](/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/jabber-powered-24.gif)

I've been deep in [Linux-country](http://ubergeek.tv/article.php?pid=54) for the past 2 days and have finally gotten a [Jabber server](http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/2/) up and running, along with the [MSN transport](http://delx.cjb.net/pymsnt/).

I'm suprised I succeeded to be honest, but by following the instructions [It Just Works](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22It+Just+Works%22+site%3Aslashdot.org). jabberd is listening on [nulltheory.com](http://nulltheory.com/), so I can be contacted via 'steve' at that domain (having multiple domains definitely seems too complicated at times...).

I've practically no knowledge of the use of public-private key encryption (studied the theory at [uni](http://www.cs.qub.ac.uk/) though) so, as with my mail server, all communication is in plaintext for the time being.I've been playing about with a few [Jabber](http://exodus.jabberstudio.org/) [clients](http://psi-im.org/) after I discovered [Gaim](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/) couldn't make use of transports and have settled on [Pandion](http://www.pandion.be/) for the time being.

Anyways, I'm outta here, the week is finally over :)
