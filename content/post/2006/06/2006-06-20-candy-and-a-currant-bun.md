Just finished [tweaking](http://imdb.com/title/tt0283003/) the site presentation, the background image was begining to [embarass](http://female101.com/edi/masturbation-paranoia.html) me.

Some work with [Photoshop](http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=photoshop) and playing with a couple of [colour](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/) [choosers](http://wellstyled.com/tools/colorscheme2/index-en.html) and viola, a new look. I love the flexibility of [CSS](http://zeldman.com/dwws/), especially when combined with the [appropriate](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) [tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/).

Now if I could only get my mail server working properly...
