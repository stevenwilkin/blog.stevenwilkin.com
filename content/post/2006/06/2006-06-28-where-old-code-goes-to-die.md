Well, I've started a million different projects and finished none, so in an effort to quell the sense of dis-ease I've went back to whatever seemed nearest to completion before I abandoned it...

...which has meant getting stuck back into Classic ASP and MS-SQL, not nice for a Linux-fanboy-wannabie like myself ;)

[Captain Beefheart's](http://www.beefheart.com/) [Trout Mask Replica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout_Mask_Replica) has been providing much needed mental stimulation while I at least try to make some progress on this thing.

The road to wherever-it-is-in-the-IT-world-I-am-actually-heading-to is certainly proving frustrating, but hey, one day at a time. You never know, someday I might well get those [1337 sk1llz](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Napoleon_Dynamite#Napoleon_Dynamite) I'm lusting after.

On a lighter note, I just over-heard a [member of staff](http://lifelong.disappointment.com/) phone the newest addition [to get her to](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=control+freak) send an email to everyone in the office to let them know that new stationary has arrived (the email is in my inbox as I type), [words escape me](http://www.pointlesswasteoftime.com/).
