![Jay and Silent Bob](/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/jay.jpg "Jay and Silent Bob")Instead of working, I've been reading a series of entries on [Kevin Smith's](http://imdb.com/name/nm0003620/) [blog](http://silentbobspeaks.com/) about [Jason Mewes](http://imdb.com/name/nm0582939/) and his [struggle](http://facesofmeth.us/main.htm) to [get clean](http://nanorthernireland.com/) \[[Part 1](http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=235), [2](http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=236), [3](http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=237), [4](http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=239), [5](http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=240), [6](http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=241), [7](http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=242), [8](http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=243), [9](http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=244)\].

Not only can you read about the origins of the immortal "snootchie bootchies" but Silent Bob also talks about the countless rounds of rehab Jason had to go through and how he only got and _stayed_ clean when he had [fallen far enough](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hitting+rock+bottom).

I'm looking forward to [Clerks 2](http://clerks2.com/) next month and, dare I say it, I might even pay for the privilege.

Snootch.

(It works if you work it!)
