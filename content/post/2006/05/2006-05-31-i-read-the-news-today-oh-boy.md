My photo has appeared in not one, but two newspapers today :)

[![Volunteer for Fun and Profit](http://sickbiscuit.com/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=33&g2_serialNumber=2 "Volunteer for Fun and Profit")](http://sickbiscuit.com/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=34&g2_serialNumber=2)This is the clipping from page 14 of the [Daily Ireland](http://dailyireland.televisual.co.uk/).

I appear by myself (and in colour) on page 8 of the [Belfast Telegraph](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/) and when I get the chance to scan the photo I'll post it here.

This is the second occasion I have been in the media as a consequence of my involvement with voluntary work.

Note to Self: don't smile like an idiot when posing for photos!
