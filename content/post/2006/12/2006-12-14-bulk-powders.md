In my time honored tradition of bulk purchasing I placed an order with [bulkpowders.co.uk](http://bulkpowders.co.uk/), which arrived last week. I refrained from documenting it at the time as I've only just had the opportunity to sample the produce and here is what was waiting for me at reception last Tuesday:

I'd been meaning to start buying my supplements online for a while but I wasn't going to be saving much going for brand name products, especially when delivery costs were factored in. I scoured through [uk-muscle.co.uk](http://uk-muscle.co.uk/) and compared the online retailers I found discussed there and decided on the aforementioned site which specialises in no-frills, bulk orders:

As you can see, the goods came packaged in food-grade buckets, with the contents described via an ink-jet printed label:

My main objective was to find a cheaper source for [whey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey_protein): I'd been buying my protein powder locally and I knew from reading various forums that there had to be a cheaper solution. A 2.27 Kg tub of [Instant Whey](http://www.reflex-nutrition.com/sports_nutrition/muscle__size/document_3_2.php) was costing me £34.95 approximately every 6 weeks, so I was pleased to find a [5 Kg bucket of unflavoured whey](http://www.bulkpowders.co.uk/product.php?xProd=41) for only £24.99:

My breakfast/pre-workout smoothie has contained this stuff for the past 2 mornings and I've had no complaints. Along with the whey and the [dextrose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrose), I ordered a couple of ["flavouring systems,"](http://www.bulkpowders.co.uk/section.php?xSec=20) chocolate and strawberry cream. I put a minuscule amount of the strawberry cream powder into into my post-swim shake and was rewarded with a pink-hued liquid which was actually quite tasty! When it comes to food, flavour isn't particularly important to me, so I suspect that I could get away without adding flavouring to my shakes but it's good to have the option if need be.

Post and packing was a pain to the wallet at £10.99, but the saving far out-weighed this cost and is unfortunately unavoidable when buying online and my only gripe with the company is that they have been out of stock of [fish oil capsules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_oil) for the past while. I'm pleased with the purchase and I suspect I'll be ordering from [bulkpowders.co.uk](http://www.bulkpowders.co.uk/) again!
