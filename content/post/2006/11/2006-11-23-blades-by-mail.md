My shipment from [Blademail.co.uk](http://www.blademail.co.uk/) arrived this morning:

I put the order through on Monday morning for a "Pillar Pack" of 100 double-edge razor blades which I'm hoping will last me for the duration of the next year:

The pack contains 20 dispensers, each delivering 5 blades:

I originally read about the [traditional wetshave on Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/grooming/introduction-to-traditional-wetshaving-197065.php), but paid no heed to it until one fateful day in Boots when I was in need of blades and low on cash and noticed how much of a difference in price there was between the "novelty" multi-blade shaving systems and the traditional single-blade setup. I was game and took the plunge. The next morning I gave it a go: my hands were trembling and my face was left resembling a [butchers block](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butchers_block) but something about the experience kept me coming back for more.

As the calendar progressed my skill with the blade has improved and the time required each morning has decreased. I still get a bit of razor burn but I don't nick myself anywhere near as often. I've also upgraded from a shaving gel to using a [brush](http://www.boots.com/shop/product_details.jsp?productid=1052619&classificationid=1010303&slmRefer=000), mug and shave cream to produce a lather for my face.

It's all time consuming and the perfect shave still eludes me but this purchase (including postage) only left my debit card £14.85 worse off. To buy that quantity of blades in packs of 10 would have cost me £30 in Boots, so that's a possible saving of £15.15 over the course of a year. 4.15p per day, I feel like I've beaten the system!
