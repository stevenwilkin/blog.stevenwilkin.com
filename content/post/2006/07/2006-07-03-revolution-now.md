![Symantec Firewall](/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/symantec.gif "Symantec Firewall")Up until a few hours ago we had a [Symantec](http://www.symantec.com/index.htm) [firewall appliance](http://www.hansenonline.net/reviews/firewall100.html) protecting the office network from script kiddies and the like, but unfortunately it was prone to crashing and required [regular rebooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd).

As I was returning from my coffee break I passed Kev who was leaving the room to go reboot said device.

![IPCop](/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/ipcop.gif "IPCop")I was in an impulsive mood and when Kev returned I offered to build a new firewall. Unfortunately I didn't get an opportunity to use any empty fairy liquid bottles or stick-back plastic, but I did grab the latest release of the excellent Linux-based [IPCop](http://ipcop.org/), an old 450MHz Dell Dimension desktop from the stack we have in the corner of our room and a spare network card that had been lying on a shelf, gathering dust.

I've been using IPCop at home for a while now and this site is running on a cobbled together machine sitting behind an old Compaq box running this fine piece of software. I used to use a commercial hardware router and the thought of running another pc just to route traffic seemed extravagant, but I haven't looked back since I first installed [Smoothwall](http://smoothwall.org/), which IPCop is based on. Being familiar with IPCop's installation and configuration proved beneficial and before I left for my lunch break the new firewall was in place and running like a champion.

So far this is the only Linux box on the network, but I like the idea of an ancient Linux box protecting all our windows desktops and dual-Xeon Server 2k3 machine (can Windows Server be run on anything less??), [don't fear the penguins](http://www.tuxme.com/)!
