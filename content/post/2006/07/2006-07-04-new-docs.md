I put in my monthly expenses claim yesterday morning and decided to follow through on a plan that had been on the back burner for a while now: getting myself some new footwear.

After sorting out the [new firewall](/2006/07/03/revolution-now/) at [the office](http://volunteering-ni.org/) I [strutted](http://www.pimpmywalk.com/) my way down to the [Doc Shop](http://www.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=doc+shop&near=Belfast&radius=0.0&cid=54595998,-5930034,459727446587914829&li=lmd&ie=UTF8&om=1&ll=54.602052,-5.927768&spn=0.010515,0.029268) and bought a new pair of 8-eye [Doc Marten](http://www.drmartens.com/) boots. Here they are fresh from the box and laced up (photos from my phone unfortunately):

They look so new and alien to me, unlike my last pair:

My old ones have moulded themselves perfectly to the form of my feet and ankles and feel more like an extension of myself than mere boots, any other footwear seems uncomfortable in comparison.

It seems unbelievable that my old docs were once the exact same shape as my new ones and it feels like I'm having to learn how to walk all over again! I can't remember how long it took to [break-in](http://www.bdsmcruise.com/) my last pair in but I can certainly recall [going out dancing](http://flickr.com/photos/eyewitness/146379016/) in them and returning home with my ankles a bloody mess (it's all about the imagery...)

My old docs held out for well over a year and a half (even though I felt a tad self-conscience wearing red boots) so here's hoping I get the same wear out of this new pair! I'm off to [abuse myself](http://flickr.com/search/?q=flagellation) at the [gym](http://www.qub.ac.uk/pec/).
