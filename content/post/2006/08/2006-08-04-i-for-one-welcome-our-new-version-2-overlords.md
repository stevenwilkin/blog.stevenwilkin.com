![World Firefox Day](/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/wffd.gif "World Firefox Day")Yesterday, my copy of [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) updated itself (to version 1.5.0.6 no less) and when it restarted I was reminded about the upcoming [World Firefox Day](http://www.worldfirefoxday.com/en/). I'd read about this on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/articles/06/07/16/1349218.shtml) a while back and just forgot about it.

I checked out the site and immediately thought of my colleage, Kevin. The $ORGANISATION's a Microsoft shop through and through and Kev, like the bulk of the staff here, sticks to the web-browser that came bundled with the OS. I've been using Firefox for over 2 years now and have never looked back: it's a memory hog, yes, but it's sooo extendable and having tabbed browsing has changed my online existence no end.

So, if by 15th September Kev downloads and installs firefox we'll get a mention on the ["Firefox Friends Wall"](http://www.worldfirefoxday.com/en/faq.php#q8) and in [Firefox 2](http://www.worldfirefoxday.com/en/faq.php#q11).

It all sounds like a good bit of [craic](http://www.irishslang.net/) but I'm not [holding my breath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoerotic_asphyxiation)!
