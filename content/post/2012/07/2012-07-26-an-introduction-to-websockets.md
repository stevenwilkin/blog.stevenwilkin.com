Last week I gave a short talk at [BelfastJS](http://belfastjs.org) outlining [WebSockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket): what they are, how you use them, examples, warnings and alternatives. That should cover the basics I think.

A few months ago [I spoke at BelfastRuby](/blog/2012/03/27/an-introduction-to-sinatra/) and it was good again to be sharing some knowledge with a bunch of people enthusiastic about technology and the local community. Hopefully we can keep things going and help make Belfast a supportive environment for those involved in the knowledge economy.

[The slides are online](http://belfastjs-websockets.herokuapp.com) along with [the code for the demo app](https://github.com/stevenwilkin/belfastjs-websockets-demo).
