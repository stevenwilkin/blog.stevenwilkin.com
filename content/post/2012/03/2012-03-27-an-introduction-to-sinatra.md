Tonight I gave an introductory talk about [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) at the second meetup of [BelfastRuby](http://belfastruby.com).

The [Converser platform](http://converser.io) I've been building this last while uses a lot of Sinatra so when I was asked to give a talk about using Ruby to develop web apps without Rails it wasn't hard to think of a subject.

This was my first technical talk and apart from a touch of nerves and forgetting some of the jokes I had in mind I think things went well. Maybe I'll end up giving another one before too long :)

The slides are available at [belfast-ruby-sinatra.herokuapp.com](http://belfast-ruby-sinatra.herokuapp.com) and make use of [showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff) which itself uses Sinatra. Meta.

The source, including the code samples, is on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevenwilkin/belfast-ruby-sinatra).

**Update:** some photos from the evening are now [available on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/fillyc/sets/72157629323664172).
