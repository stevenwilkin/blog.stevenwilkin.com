I've just released the first iteration of [hometi.me](http://hometi.me) which provides an answer to the important question of [is it home time yet?](http://hometi.me)

My general dislike of working for a living inspired me to craft a [python script](/2008/04/14/big_corp-rides-the-snake-my-first-python-script/) during my tenure at $BIG\_CORP and last week the creativity bug bit me and I decided to quickly develop a web-application and get it publicly available. Thanks [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org)!

I'm following the "release early, release often" philosophy and as such this iteration only has the most basic of functionality but I've some more interesting/useful things planned and will get them out as soon as possible.
