Once again it was my weekly deadlift session this morning but unfortunately I have no injuries to share with you all this time:(

My lower-back and hips took a battering though so I might me complaining tomorrow and there would appear to be a possibility of having some tasty bruising over my left clavicle and anterior deltoid from doing front-squats of which I'll post a photo of if they "shine through" :)

This session culminated in 98% of the maximum intensity for my 5-rep deadlift, so all being well next week will see 100% and things will then take on a more psychological edge as the fear of lifting a progressively heavier weight kicks in.

Love/hate all the way!
