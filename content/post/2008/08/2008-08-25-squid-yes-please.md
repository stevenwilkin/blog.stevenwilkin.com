When I'm out in a Chinese restaurant my favorite dishes to order usually involve seafood, with salted chili squid being a regular delight.

Squid is something I had never even thought of cooking before and recently my good friend Nick K mentioned that it was not only easy to cook but also inexpensive to buy from the [ethnic store](http://maps.google.com/maps?latlng=16126094969109930315) just down the road from me.

In my naivity I presumed the squid I purchased to resemble that served to hungry diners, albeit uncooked and frozen, so you can imagine my surprise when I defrosted a box and saw a bunch of these guys staring out at me:

A primal fear rose in me yet I was determined to see the process through. Some furious googling provided me with necessary instructions on [how to prepare squid](http://www.cooks.com/rec/story/168/#AB) and I got busy gutting and cleaning:

I chopped the mantle into rings and after 90 seconds stir-fry in a hot wok this was the result:

A perfect [high protein](http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts/finfish-and-shellfish-products/4197/2) snack, moderate in carbs and fat. Nom.
