A couple of months ago I decided to add some variety to my [strength training program](/2008/09/07/current-strength-training-program/).

The main change has been to alternate between front and back squats. The higher frequency with the back squat has brought some much needed practice to an exercise I find mechanically more difficult to perform, quite possibly due to [difficulties with my right knee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgood-Schlatter_disease) I had when I was a teenager.

Through the influence of [stronglifts.com](http://stronglifts.com/) I've developed an interest in the olympic-style lifts and have been practicing the [power clean](http://stronglifts.com/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-power-cleans/) twice a week. This has brought an extra dimension of power, speed and technique to my training and proved a "tonic," buoying my enthusiasm for lifting.

The final change has been to train all the different [pull-up/chin-up grips](http://www.wannabebig.com/article.php?articleid=255): neutral, supinated and pronated. The pull-up has been quite a challenge and I've really had to focus on progress, not perfection, leaving my ego at the weights-room door and emphasising strict form at all times.
