I'm spending a few days down the country before I start my new my job catching up with my family, tinkering on some personal projects and just generally "getting my head showered."

I'm enjoying the break from the daily grind with my only real task being to steel myself for the upcoming change to my 9-5 existence. I find myself _so_ resistant to change: my levels of **Fear**, **Uncertainty** and **Doubt** seem to automatically soar at the prospect of anything out of the ordinary, but I'm presented with a great opportunity to sharpen my development skills within a lower-pressure environment. Score!

Expect details of my new gig soon.
