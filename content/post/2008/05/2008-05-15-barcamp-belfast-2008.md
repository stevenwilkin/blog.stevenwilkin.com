I attended [BarCamp](http://www.barcamp.org/BarCampBelfast) [last year](/2007/06/27/barcamp-belfast/) and I heard [this morning](http://cimota.com/blog/2008/05/15/barcampbelfast-2008/) that details of this year's [un-conference have been confirmed](http://goodonpaper.org/entries/barcamp-confirmed/).

The fun is happening on Saturday 21st June, 9am - 5pm in the Peter Froggatt Centre at Queens University Belfast.

See you there!
