I read [Trent's post on preparing oats](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/05/09/making-your-own-homemade-oatmeal-packets-a-visual-guide-and-cost-analysis/) at the weekend and decided to write about my own process. I'm also relieved I'm not the only one doing this kind of thing ;)

Part of my weekend routine involves preparing my breakfasts for the coming week. I boil a large saucepan of eggs which end up in a tupperware box in my fridge and I start a process which results in the following:

Each container contains:

- oats
- raisins
- teaspoon of cinnamon
- pinch of sea-salt

Each week-morning, after I've washed and dressed, all that's left to do is dump the contents of one the containers into a saucepan, add water and shell a few boiled eggs while my oats cook.

This leads to my favourite part of the day: eating a cooked breakfast and drinking fresh coffee while catching up on my RSS feeds.
