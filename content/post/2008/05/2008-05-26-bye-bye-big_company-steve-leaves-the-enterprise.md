I'm preparing myself for my last cycle home from $BIG\_COMPANY.

On the whole the experience has been, well, experience: neither good nor bad but worthwhile all the same. I do have gray hairs now though.

Soon, process monitoring, environment management, receiving 700 emails a day and being on-call will be a distant memory. Along with my nemesis of the past 9.5 months, the Tibco [TIC](https://customers.reuters.com/rmds/czrdp/ecopages/ApplicationDetails.aspx?temp=289).

And yes, before you ask, I have my [name barrel](/2007/11/02/thats-me-that-is/) in my pannier bag ;)
