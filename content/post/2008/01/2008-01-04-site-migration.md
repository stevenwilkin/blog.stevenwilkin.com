I've just finished migrating sickbiscuit.com from my home development machine to my new VPS.

DNS records have been updated and `decaf` is now handling mail and web traffic for the domain allow the only thing I've copied over is this blog.

Hopefully this will give me the motivation needed to spruce things up a bit as the last iteration of sickbiscuit.com looked like it was designed by a programmer ;)
