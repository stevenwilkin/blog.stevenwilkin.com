I met my co-conspirator [Aidan](http://godswearhats.com/) in person for the first time today. He's over here in sunny Belfast for a while and is working up on the third floor of the same building as myself, so we had a bit of lunch and got chatting about our plans for the future, our experiences of working for $BIG\_CORP and life in general.

It was good to finally put a physical person to the online persona and apparently neither of us looks like the photos we use as avatars ;)

Go team Infurious!
