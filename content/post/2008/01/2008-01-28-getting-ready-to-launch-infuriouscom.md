I'm preparing to push my code for the new Infurious site into production so we can start selling our first application, Rickshaw.

The site's not too pretty but It Works and our freshly recruited designer [Jordan](http://onetoad.com/) has some interesting ideas for the next iteration. All the important stuff is present: people can download Rickshaw, purchase a license and the license details will be generated and mailed out to them. I've just had a dry run of this scenario and it all looks good.

Thankfully [Aidan](http://godswearhats.com/) has been at hand and steered me away from over-engineering the project and ending up with just a mess of unfinished code :)

Doing this and holding down a 9 to 5 I've found difficult and the progress has been painfully slow but it will all be worth it.

Watch this space!
