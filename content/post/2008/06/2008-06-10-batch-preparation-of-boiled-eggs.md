In my post on [batch preparation of oats](/2008/05/12/oats-weekly-batch-preparation/), written in response to [Trent's post](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/05/09/making-your-own-homemade-oatmeal-packets-a-visual-guide-and-cost-analysis/), I mentioned that I also prepare the boiled eggs I enjoy for breakfast in advance.

At the weekend past I'd just boiled a saucepan of eggs, cooled them with cold water and put them into a tupperware box when I remembered my previous post, so I took a quick snap to provide a follow-up:

Whole, boiled eggs will keep for up to a week in their shells in the fridge and provide an excellent source of complete protein, saturated fat and dietary cholesterol along with a hearty dose of Vitamin D, all of which are essential to those pursuing an active lifestyle which includes weight training.

Don't fear the fat and eat those yolks!
