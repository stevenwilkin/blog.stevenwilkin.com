There have been times in my life when my job description could well have been best described as being a [professional coffee drinker](http://stevenwilkin.com/). These days however I've found gainful employment but continue to consume vast quantities of the stuff and even use coffee nomenclature to name my new \*nix boxes.

During a caffeine-fuelled session with my domain registrar I happened to lookup [professionalcoffeedrinker.com](http://professionalcoffeedrinker.com/); it was available, all sense went out the window and my money and myself were swiftly parted.

I wonder if this acquisition will have any effect on the [Google Juice](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GoogleJuice) of the personal brand I have an eye to developing? And before you ask, yes, SEO information has been trickling it's way into my RSS reader recently.
