Monday was my first day as a developer with [Creative Online Media](http://creativeonlinemedia.com/) and I must say it's great to be wearing my coding hat again.

The culture-shock has been enormous: I'm not flooded with emails and phone calls all day, nor battling with bureaucracy and the people are really chilled-out. I don't know myself!

The adjustment period will end and no doubt I'll be required to produce product but I think this gig has potential :)
