I've just released the latest iteration of my "professional" site, [stevenwilkin.com](http://stevenwilkin.com).

There's the possibility [the designers I'm working with](http://creativeonlinemedia.com/about/ourteam.html) will think my design-fu is weak, but the site badly needed **something** as it has been barely put to use in the years I've owned it.

I don't know how the [Steven Wilkin](http://professionalcoffeedrinker.com) web experience will evolve but the words of Eric S. Raymond are ringing true when he mentions [not hiding behind a hacker-style alias](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#style) so I may put more emphasis on this domain in the future.

The future is looking exciting concerning the web and my own contribution to it these days so who knows what will transpire and of course I invite you all along for the ride :)
