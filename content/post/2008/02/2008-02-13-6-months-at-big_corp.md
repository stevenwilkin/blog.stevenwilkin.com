I can hardly believe it, today I'm 6 calendar months into my position as [Analyst Programmer](/2007/08/13/citi/) at $BIG\_CORP.

How time has flown. More surprisingly, I **almost** seem to have grown accustomed to the stress of working with mission-critical systems and getting called-out in the wee hours of the night.
