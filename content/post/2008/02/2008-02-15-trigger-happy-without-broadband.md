For 2 days now the "ready" light on my cable modem has failed to light up and hence I've had no internet access at home :( I've tried power-cycling the modem, leaving it unplugged overnight and even disconnecting and reconnecting the cable input. No Joy.

I checked the [Virgin Media service status page](http://status-cable.virginmedia.com/vmstatus/summary.do) and can see that there was maintenance scheduled for Belfast this morning, maybe this will remedy the problem...

My morning routine has evolved to consist of catching up on RSS while eating breakfast and guzzling coffee, so this ritual has been disrupted and as an alternative to plugging in to my feed reader I had a look through my home folder for one of the many eBooks I've downloaded and not finished reading.

The lucky contestant turned out to be the freely downloadable [Trigger Happy by Steven Poole](http://stevenpoole.net/blog/trigger-happier/) and what a dose of nostalgia it's been!

I haven't seriously played any computer games in about a decade now but this book lists many of the titles I invested many hours into when I was younger. I was brought back to the days of sitting hunched over machines like the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, Amiga 600 and NES and I've even considered investing in a new console although my need to save for my future is overriding my want for something new and shiny which I might not even make much use of.

Saying that though I'll probably end up grabbing an Amiga Emulator or MAME at some point over the weekend, Virgin Media willing, and catch up on a few childhood memories.

Game on!
