As I mentioned [yesterday](/2008/02/15/trigger-happy-without-broadband/), my broadband had been on the blink and this morning I decided to take action as I need to do some work from home this weekend.

Just before 9am I phoned tech support and was surprised to not have to wait on hold: my call was answered almost immediately. The support guy was polite and after I explained the situation he tested the line from his end and without any messing around scheduled to have an engineer sent out between 12 and 4pm.

At 12:15 my buzzer went and about 10 minutes later I had a new modem. The engineer had quickly tested the signal strength and determined that it was the hardware that was at fault and swiftly had it replaced. Result.

All that was left to do was ssh into my [router](http://ipcop.org) and bring the external network interface down and then back up again and voila, the gift of broadband was mine again :)

This incident was a far cry from my experience of [NTL's customer support](http://cablehell.co.uk/forums/index.php?showtopic=27097&st=0&p=156841&#entry156841). Thumbs up for Virgin Media!
