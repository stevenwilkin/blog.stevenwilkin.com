Over the past few months I haven't been quite the gym freak that I've been in the past but one exercise I have continued to regularly train has been the [deadlift](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/ErectorSpinae/BBDeadlift.html).

Saturday mornings had become my sole weekly strength session so I had to ensure I was getting as much bang for my buck as possible and nothing works the body like this exercise.

I haven't set a new personal record in any of the big movements since about November so it was a good boost to exceed my previous best. This morning's effort was the culmination of 8 weeks work: starting off at a relatively low intensity and adding weight to the bar each time. I had planned on reaching this stage sooner but I noticed one Saturday that I couldn't grip the bar properly and found I had developed a blister which proceeded to burst, resulting in missing my target for that session and slowing my progress.

I've recently been reading up on [Mark Rippetoe's](http://www.startingstrength.com/authors.html) techniques and slowly moving away from those of [Stuart McRobert](/2007/01/31/abbreviated-weight-training/), hence the 5 reps, and I'll probably start a ["Practical Programming"](http://www.practicalprogrammingforstrengthtraining.com/) style training cycle once I've finished reading the book and absorbing it's material. Squats every workout? Brilliant :)

The question now though is, can I keep the progression coming and lift heavier next time?
