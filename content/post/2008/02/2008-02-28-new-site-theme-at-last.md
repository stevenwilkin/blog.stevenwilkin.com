I finally got around to replacing the default WordPress theme. Now it doesn't look like I don't care about my site :)

With so many freely available themes I found it difficult to choose but I stumbled upon [plaintxt.org](http://www.plaintxt.org/) and my mind was made up: I needed one of those minimalist themes and I opted for the [Barthelme](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/barthelme/) which I am liking very much.

For posterity I took a screenshot of my old, hand-crafted design:
