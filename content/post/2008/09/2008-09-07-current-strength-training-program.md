For nearly 3 months my strength training has revolved around [squatting 3 times a week](/2008/06/27/squatting-3-times-a-week-and-a-return-to-early-morning-training) and this is my current program:

- Monday
    - Front squat
    - Neutral-grip chin up
    - Parallel bar dip

- Wednesday
    - Back squat
    - Overhead press
    - Row

- Friday
    - Front squat
    - Dumbbell bench press
    - Deadlift

All squats are done to [below parallel](http://www.cbass.com/Squats.htm) with all free-weight exercises being performed for 3 sets of 5 repetitions, after warm-ups, with the exception of the deadlift for which my "work" consists of a single set of 5 reps.

My focus, as always, has been on periodisation: a few weeks working up from approximately 85% to 100% of my previous best followed by a couple of weeks setting new bests ending with maybe a few days out of the gym and starting back at 85% again. I find the shorter periods of progressive poundages to be easier to manage psychologically than perhaps 7 or 8 weeks of progress that I have aimed for in the past.

This program appears to be working for me: I've never been stronger and my [intimidation of the squat](/2006/09/01/squat-or-rot/) has greatly diminished due to the higher frequency. I still have to leave my ego at the weights-room door though: there will also be a person who can lift heavier, one who's bigger and yet another who's leaner.
