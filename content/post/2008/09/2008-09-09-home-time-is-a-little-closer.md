Before calling it a day last night I pushed out another release of my "toy" web-application, [hometi.me](http://hometi.me). Thank you Capistrano!

[I mentioned last month](/2008/08/12/is-it-home-time-yet/) that I was intending on following the "release early, release often" paradigm with this project, but as always, life had other plans and I found myself doing very little hacking outside of the 9-5. Regardless, I believe this release provides a great deal of extra functionality and I'm content to just have gotten the code out the door.

I've had some great fun playing with AJAX for this release and I was pleasantly surprised to see how [my understanding of this technology](/2007/02/21/ajax-first-impressions/) has increased in the past year and a half. JavaScript now has a warm place in my heart ;)
