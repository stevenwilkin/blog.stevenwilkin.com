I've just shutdown the beige box that [was home to this blog](/2006/05/24/and-so-the-legend-grows/) for just over a year and a half until [I started renting a VPS](/2008/01/04/site-migration/).

I had intended to shutdown this machine since the start of the year but never got around to it and after a techie chat on IM with [Dave Dripps](http://www.redfurredbear.com/) earlier in the day decided to just "pull the finger out" and do the needful.

I archived the contents of `/var/www/htdocs` and my home directory for safe keeping, copying them over to my file server, and dumped all the MySQL databases I still hadn't migrated.

Self-hosting a site was a great learning opportunity but not something a business could be built up upon and comparing the energy cost of running a machine 24x7 versus renting a VPS priced in American Dollars the choice wasn't hard to make, it's just a shame it took me half a year to finally flick the switch.

Goodnight `substance`!
