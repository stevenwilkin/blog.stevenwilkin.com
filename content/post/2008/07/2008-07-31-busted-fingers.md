Continuing what appears to be turning into a [series detailing](/2008/06/27/squatting-3-times-a-week-and-a-return-to-early-morning-training) [my training injuries](/2008/07/18/bloody-shins/) I present the following:

I nipped my finger loading extra plates onto the bar during the warm-up sets of my last deadlift session and I must say it looked more "impressive" covered with [magnesium carbonate](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Camp-Chalk-Block/dp/B0013AK876?tag=sickbiscuitco-21) and dripping blood ;)

More haste, less speed may be required next time.
